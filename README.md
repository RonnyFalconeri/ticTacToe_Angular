# TicTacToe with Angular



## Introduction

### About the game

Tic-Tac-Toe originally is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, _X_ and _O_, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid.
The goal: one player succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row. 
The game results in a draw if every field is marked without having reached the goal by both players.

### Used technology
The game is developed with Angular and generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.


To ensure functional stability, different unit tests were written with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


The application was styled using [SCSS/SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). Additionally, the user interface is also responsive:
